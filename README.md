# Kenken-Constraint-Satisfaction-Problem-
This project involves implementation of CSP propagators, a Forward Checking constraint propagator, and a Generalized Arc Consistence (GAC) constraint propagator propagator—and three heuristics— Minimum-Remaining-Value (MRV), Degree (DH), and Least-Constraining-Value (LCV). Three different CSP models was involved: two grid-only KenKen models, and one full KenKen puzzle model (adding cage constraints to grid).
